**[Redundant save() Call](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootRedundantSave)**

**Description:** This application is an example when calling `save()` for a managed entity is redundant.

**Key points:**\
     - Hibernate triggers `UPDATE` statements for managed entities without the need to explicitly call the `save()` method\
     - behind the scene, this redundancy implies a performance penalty as well
