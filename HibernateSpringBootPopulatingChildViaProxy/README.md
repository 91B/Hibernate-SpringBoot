**[Populating a Child-Side Parent Association via Proxy](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootPopulatingChildViaProxy)**

**Description:** A `Proxy` can be useful when a child entity can be persisted with a reference to its parent. In such cases, fetching the parent entity from the database (execute the `SELECT` statement) is a performance penalty and a pointless action. Hibernate can set the underlying foreign key value for an uninitialized `Proxy`.

**Key points:**\
     - rely on `EntityManager#getReference()`\
     - in Spring, use `JpaRepository#getOne()` -> used in this example\
     - in Hibernate, use `load()`\
     - here, we have two entities, `Tournament` and `TennisPlayer`, and a tournament can have multiple players (`@OneToMany`)\
     - we fetch the tournament via a `Proxy` (this will not trigger a `SELECT`), we create a new tennis player, we set the `Proxy` as the tournament for this player and we save the player (this will trigger an `INSERT` in the tennis players table, `tennis_player`)
     
**Output example:**\
     - the console output will reveal that only an `INSERT` is triggered, not the `SELECT`
