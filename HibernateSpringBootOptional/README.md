**[Use Java 8 Optional in Entities and Queries](https://github.com/AnghelLeonard/Hibernate-SpringBoot/tree/master/HibernateSpringBootOptional)**

**Description:** This application is a proof of concept of how is correct to use the Java 8 `Optional` in entities and queries. 

**Key points:**\
     - use the Spring Data built-in query-methods that return `Optional` (e.g., `findById()`)\
     - write your own queries that return `Optional`\
     - use `Optional` in entities getters\
     - in order to run different scenarios check the file, data-mysql.sql
